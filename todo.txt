Todo:

MAP:
* add station height
* correct coordinates (by now only approximately) 
* if somehow possible: connected to shown location
  (either by clicking on map show location, or by choosing the tab -> highlight the location
* Map could also show up only in an additional tab

Data plots:
* Accumulated precipitation - might be overlapping with sunshine
* annotate daily min/max temperature, precipitation sum
* Hover: would be nice to link upper and lower panel
* zoom & pan: do not allow to zoom/pan out of data range

General:
* Axis (Font size, description, color...)

Table (or sth similar):
* current values
* ev. some basic statistics
